## How to Run

1. Open **PowerShell**.
2. Navigate to the folder containing these scripts:
   ```powershell
   cd "path\to\Windows-Tweaks"
   ```
3. Run a script by typing `.\` followed by the filename:
   ```powershell
   .\Disable-Startup-Delay.ps1
   ```

> **Note:** A **system restart** is recommended after running these scripts (especially `Reduce-Latency.ps1` and `Disable-Startup-Delay.ps1`) to ensure all registry changes and service configurations take effect.

### Troubleshooting
If you see an error stating that "running scripts is disabled on this system", you can run the script with the Execution Policy bypass flag:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Disable-Startup-Delay.ps1
```
